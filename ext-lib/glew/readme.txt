#ifdef TXTFILE_BLODY_HELL_DO_NOT_INCLUDE

So, this is actually.. 
MUTILATED GLEW..

This is because, I hate all configuration, on IDE specific, or operating system
or project specific ways.. 

Basically all I did, was that I replaced all #include <GL/glew.h> style includes with #include "glew.h" style..
this way, there is no need to define -I or any other nonsense in compilation.

#endif
